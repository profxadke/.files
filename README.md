# `.files`
My personal favorite **[dot]** files which I would love to share!



**NOTE**: Make sure you've got a few stuff before you're expecting things to work out of the box.

##### Stuff you'll need:

- [ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install)
- [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
- [antidote](https://getantidote.github.io/install)
- [lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd)
- [chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) / pygmentize
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) **\[Linux Only\]**
- [nerdfonts*](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)

**NOTE**: If some shell commands like `cat`, `less`, etc. are bugging you please add a backslash `\` before the command. Making it look like `\cat > lulz << EOF`

*You may also use any other **supported** font(s) too :slightly_smiling_face:
